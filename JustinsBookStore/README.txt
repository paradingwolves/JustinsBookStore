- After getting to the same spot after closely following the tutorial I am still getting these errors
- I tried playing around with using statements in my Startup.cs file
	- Now My only error is in the ErrorViewModel
	- added this line to the top of Error.cshtml and now project builds without errors: @using JustinsBookStore.Models.ViewModels 
- Time to make a new gitHub repo
